Accumulo 1.6.0 / Play 2.2.3 Module
======================================

This project provides a very simple plugin for Play 2.2.3 that allows easy access accumulo 1.6.0 database connections.  The [Apache Accumulo](http://accumulo.apache.org) sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, scalable, high performance data storage and retrieval system.  Apache Accumulo is based on Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org), [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org), and [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org).

Installation
------------

Add the following dependency to your ``build.sbt``:

    val appDependencies = Seq(
        "com.schwartech" %% "accumulo-plugin" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT",
    )

    resolvers += (
        "SchwarTech GitHub Repository" at "http://jschwartz73.github.io/play2-accumulo/"
    )

Configuration
-------------

The following are the default settings available for the accumulo plugin.  Modify them to fit your environment

    accumulo.instanceName=mock-accumulo  # This uses Accumulo's mock instance, which is an in-memory fake implementation used primarily for unit testing

    accumulo.memBuf=1000000
    accumulo.timeout=1000
    accumulo.numThreads=10

    accumulo.zooServers="localhost:2181"
    accumulo.username=root
    accumulo.password=password

Usage
-----

See the sample app for an example of usage.

A few notes:

* This is a very early implementation.  Currently it just eases configuration and getting an accumulo connection.
* Contributions are encouraged
* I've started a "Document" based add-on to simplify some common queries, etc.  This will probably be a separate project
